Fields

USER_ID
Oracle ID that uniquely identifies a user.
USER_CNTRY_ID
The country ID of the country that this user lives in.
This value is very important, since it determines where we attribute revenue from that seller. Revenue is assigned based on seller country.
Joins to DataWarehouse/Lookups/DW_COUNTRIES
USER_CRE_DATE
The timestamp that the user record was created on the site. This date should never change.
This is populated once the user reaches the RU state. Confirmation is NOT required to have a user record created.
USER_SLCTD_ID
The eBay username chosen by the user. This is the name that most people see on the site.
This does NOT contain the multi-byte user ID for multi-byte sites. That's stored in MBYTE_USERID (see below).
This field is NOT guaranteed to be unique.  There are several cases where two different user_id have the same user_slctd_id.  See 'dealgenius' or 'leisurepro' as examples (rdieckma Apr 27,2012). As of Dec 2012 there are more than 7 million such duplicate or even triplicate cases (uwemayer).
USER_SITE_ID
The site ID the user registered on.
This can't change (true?) once the record has been created.
In 2008, I changed my USER_SITE_ID from US to CH simply by calling CS and requesting it!
It can be changed by user but it can’t be changed too often. You can get the data by the following data (Details provided by Jun He):
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM dw_user_info_chg WHERE user_info_chg_type_id = 12 AND chg_dt > '2011-01-01'

USER_STS_CODE
User status code
Lots of status information stored here. Important note: eBay Express, Half and Shopping.com users will get a "Confirmed" value despite not having gone through an email confirmation step.
Potential values are:
-1 = Unknown
0 = Suspended
1 = Confirmed
2 = Unconfirmed
3 = Ghost
4 = In Maintenance
5 = Deleted (can be used to differentiate junk / inactive records corresponding to same User Selected IDs)
6 = CC Verify
7 = Account on Hold
8 = Merged
9 = Reg Code Email Out
10 = Term Pending
11 = Unconfirmed (Half Opt In)
12 = CC Verify (Half Opt In)
13 = Unconfirmed (Passport)
14 = CC Verify (Passport)
15 = Unconfirmed (Express)
16 = Visitor
17 = Guest (Created in Streamlined BIN project)
99999999 = Invalid
The lookup table for this field is DW_USER_STATUS_CODES.
The definitive location for the values in this field is in ClearCase at: /v3core/CoreDomain/CoreDomainCommon/src/com/ebay/domain/core/common/UserEnum.java
DATE_CONFIRM
The date the user became a confirmed member.
There are potential issues with this field, since it doens't necessarily represent the FIRST time the user became a CRU.
Also, there are two known cases (Half, Express and Shopping.com users) where a user has a NULL value in this field but is a confirmed user (USER_STS_CODE = 1). So this field can't always be used to test confirmed status.
USER_CRE_PRD_ID
USER_CRE_WEEK_ID
USER_NAME
Also a split based on the users first and last name (USER_FIRST_NAME,USER_LAST_NAME) can be obtained in PRS_SECURE_V.DW_USERS.

CITY
STATE
PSTL_CODE
DAYPHONE
Primary phone number of the user. Frequently the numbers are transformed to be pipe-delimited values (e.g. "415|999|8260").
Note that if you're attempting to contact this user, you MUST ensure that this user has agreed to be contacted by phone (the WANT_TELEMARKETING flag below).
EMAIL
Contains the user's email address.
This column is considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information), and hence isn't available in ACCESS_VIEWS, but is exposed for users who have PII access privileges in PRS_SECURE_V
Note that if you're attempting to contact this user, you MUST ensure that this user has agreed to be contacted by phone (the TAKE_PART_IN_SURVEYS flag below).
Cannot be the same for multiple accounts; sometimes it seems one email for multiple accounts, but after careful check, one/more space following the email makes them different emails.  It may be a site issue.
FAXPHONE
NIGHTPHONE
CELLPHONE
FEEDBACK_SCORE
Contains the user's current feedback score
Some (probably old) records have a FEEDBACK_SCORE value of NULL.
GENDER_MFU
M = Male
F = Female
U = Unknown - User did not fill in gender information during registraion
D = 'Deleted' indicates that PD has soft deleted inactive user and all PII information in DW has been removed.
GOOD_CRD_YN
LAST_MODFD
PREF_CATEG_INTEREST1_ID
Contains the users' first Favorite Category
Note that currently this category ID can ONLY map to the user's site of registration, so when joining to DW_CATEGORY_GROUPINGS, use the USER_SITE_ID to do so.
PREF_CATEG_INTEREST2_ID
Contains the users' second Favorite Category
PREF_CATEG_INTEREST3_ID
Contains the users' third Favorite Category
PREF_CATEG_INTEREST4_ID
Contains the users' fourth Favorite Category

Potential values: 'Y' = Take part, 'N' = Don't take part.
LINKED_PAYPAL_ACCT
PayPal account ID
This is an encrypted value. However, it is based on a standard encryption methodology, so the encrypted value should match with other encrypted account IDs.
Joins to DataWarehouse/PayPal/DW_PP_ACCT.PP_ACCT_ID
Join to this table to check Paypal verified status
Linking eBay and PayPal accounts makes buying on eBay even easier in conditions where the seller accepts PayPal. The buyer can use eBay's Checkout process to quickly pay for the item and have it shipped to the preferred address.
PAYPAL_LINK_STATE
Indicates the state of PayPal linkage for this eBay user.
Is directly pulled from site table (no transformation) and hence it’s not 100% accurate, due to API call disconnection between PayPal PD and eBay PD (Updated on Mar 30, 2010)
Potential values: (NULL = Never attempted to link, 0 = No link found, 1 = Hard link (link initialized & confirmed by user), 2 = Soft link (link created by batch application matching eBay & PayPal emails - not confirmed by user, 3 = Hard Unlink (user explicitly unlinks the two accouts)

UVDETAIL
UV stands for "user verification"; this is a mechanism to determine whether a user has provided accurate information when registering.
uvdetail is a set of bit-flags which each indicate whether a particular test of the user's information passed. For example, one test simply checks if the phone number is at least 10 digits long. Another test checks if the area code matches the state (area codes never serve more than one state, so if you have an area code you can find out what state it is for). Each bit in the uvdetail field shows whether or not the associated test was passed.
UVRATING
uvrating is a numeric score indicating how good the user's information looks. If all tests are passed the user will have a score of 13. If all tests are failed the user will have a score of negative 51. There are two special values for this field, negative 99999 which means the rating was not calculated, and negative 99998 which means the user lives in a country that we don't know how to rate (I once was a bit surprised to find out that in Germany, even in the same city, different people may have phone numbers of different length. This probably makes verification checks like this a lot harder).
Note: 83305 users on minimart (and thus on production) have null values for uvdetail. Of those, 82358 are "ghost" users, who were registered on AuctionWeb but never confirmed on eBay. Only 649 confirmed users, out of some 15 million, have null uvrating. None of these 649 have an ebay_user_info record, so we can assume their information is junk
Bit values and scoring system can be found at: http://iweb.corp.ebay.com/SiteDBAs/Documents/FAQs/uvrating.htm
That table should really be recreated in the wiki but I'm too lazy to do it right now

USER_CONFIRM_CODE

EBX_ELGBL_SLR_YN_ID
Top-level flag indicating seller's eBay Express qualification.
This flag is derived by the DW. It is a rollup of the other four eBay Express flags. The logic used for the rollup is, this value is only set to 1 when the user has not been forced out by CS, has not opted out in My eBay, and is qualified via either the batch job or CS force in.
EBX_QLFD_SLR_YN_ID
Indicates whether this seller is qualified based on the batch job for that seller's country.
Note that in early release, only US sellers will ever qualify this way, as the German site is planning to manually vet their sellers, and will be setting the batch so that the batch never qualifies sellers.

TOP_BYR_GMB_SCORE
Based on a monthly calculation performed by DW. The upstream column is USER_PRGRM_HST.PRGRM_ID, which belong to Subject Area of User Segmentation.  More definition of this column refer to http://iweb.corp.ebay.com/prod/V3/DataModel/Reports/UserReadWriteNHost/UserReadWriteNHost_files/User76.htm#1. As of 2013/06/19 that link says: Top Buyer Webform Support - This project evaluates buyers based on their GMB only and is used for Webform submissions to route Top Buyers to the new Top Buyer support teams. The DW will determine a Top Buyer Score and a Top Buyer Bucket and provide a monthly feed to site. The buckets are: 1 (Top 1%), 5 (2-5%), and 30 (6-30%). This is a global implementation, with US, UK, DE, and IE being the drivers behind this initiative. The columns previously added TOP_BUYER_SCORE and TOP_BUYER_LEVEL were created for the Buyer Activity Accelerator project (http://tracker.corp.ebay.com/cfdocs/proddev/releaseschedule/feature_view_details.cfm?parentid=5153): This project evaluates buyers based on their GMB and 40+ buyer activities and will be a PowerBuyer program, much like the PowerSeller program. The DW will determine a Top Buyer Score and a Top Buyer Level and provide a monthly feed to site. The levels are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium. This is a global initiative, but US, UK, DE, and IE will not be using this scoring/segmentation method. I [who?] thought this project was going to get cancelled because of this, but I [who?] just talked to the Product Manager today [when?] (Diana Baraniewicz) and she informed me that there are a number of international countries that want to implement this so it appears this project will get revamped.
